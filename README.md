<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Tabular Data Generator

Tabular data generator model based on the integration of Gaussian Mixture model and Variational Autoencoders as explained by Patricia et al in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08434). 

Dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset).


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
You should have the following installed on your machine:

* Ubuntu
* Python 3.8.0
* Packages in requirements.txt

  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### Installation

Download the repo manually (as a .zip file) or clone it using Git.
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/mosesdaudu001/Gaussian-Mixture-Model_Variational-Autoencoder
   ```


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

You can specify different configurations or training parameters in utils.py for both models.


To train/test the proposed model and show results, run the following command:
   ```sh
